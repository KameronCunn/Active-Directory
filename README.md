# Active Directory

## Objective

This project focuses on strengthening the security posture of Active Directory (AD) environments by identifying vulnerabilities, implementing best-practice hardening techniques, and ensuring continuous monitoring to mitigate potential threats. The project aims to safeguard against common AD attack vectors such as privilege escalation, credential theft, and unauthorized access. Key components include deploying Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security policies, auditing AD configurations for potential misconfigurations, and integrating Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems for real-time alerting on suspicious activities. By implementing a defense-in-depth strategy, this project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to securing an organization's identity management infrastructure.
